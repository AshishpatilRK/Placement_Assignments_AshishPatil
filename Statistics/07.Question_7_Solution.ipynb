    "    2Y = -X + 5\n",
    "    Y = (-1/2)X + 5/2\n",
    "    Since the equation for Y is in the form Y = aX + b, where a is the coefficient of X and b is the intercept, \n",

    "    a. Variance of Y:\n",
    "    The variance of Y can be calculated using the formula: Var(Y) = a^2 * Var(X)\n",
    "    Given that the variance of X is 4, we substitute the values:\n",
    "    Var(Y) = (-1/2)^2 * 4\n",

    "    Substituting the values:\n",
    "    R^2 = (4 - 4) / 4\n",
    "    R^2 = 0 / 4\n",
