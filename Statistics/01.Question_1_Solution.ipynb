    "* A correlation coefficient of 0.7 indicates a strong positive relationship between SAT scores and college GPA. The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect positive relationship, 0 represents no relationship, and -1 represents a perfect negative relationship. \n",
    "* In this case, the correlation coefficient of 0.7 suggests a strong positive association, indicating that higher SAT scores are generally associated with higher college GPAs.\n",
    "* It's important to note that correlation does not imply causation. While the correlation coefficient indicates a relationship between SAT scores and college GPA, it does not establish a cause-and-effect relationship. Other factors, such as study habits, motivation, and personal circumstances, can also influence college GPA and should be considered when interpreting the results.\n"
